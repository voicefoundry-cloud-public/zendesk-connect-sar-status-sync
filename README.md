Zendesk SAR Application to support Zendesk-to-Connect agent status syncing

## Installation and Use
Connect Agent Status Syncing for Zendesk is an optional add-on to the [Amazon Connect app for Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com/apps/support/amazon-connect/?q=mkp_amazon) version 3.1 or later. Based on the mapping between Zendesk unified agent statuses and Amazon Connect agent statuses, configured by a Zendesk instance admin in the main app, it automatically updates Connect agent status when the Zendesk agent status changes.
